						<p>
							By the time I was 18, I had lived in 4 states and 2 countries.  Travelling to the unknown, exploring new thoughts, and learning foreign languages are thus inherent aspects of my childhood and continue to be goals for my future.  To date, I speak three languages: English, French, and Spanish.  In my lifetime, I aspire to learn at least five.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							I consider coding to be the "international language" of our future, harnessing the power to unite minds and surpass borders.  Technology has proven itself to be a unique blend of both science and art, and I am eager to study the articulation of its parts.  Ultimately, I hope to wield the power of programming for good.  A personal dream I have is to enventually pair my coding skills with my financial background and create an application that advances economy in places rich in talent yet poor in commercial investment.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							I expect this course to act as a continual test of character and mind, yet I also perceive it as a channel for creativity and endless creation.  I am excited to venture through this journey together and welcome the challenge.  Let's do this!
